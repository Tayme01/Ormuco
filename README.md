# temidayo_oluseun_test

As per instructions, all but one of the questions - Question C - have been built to the required specifications.

This question is missing the folllowing features:

  - Resilient to network failures or crashes.
  - Near real time replication of data across Geolocation. Writes need to be in real time.
  - Data consistency across regions
  - Locality of reference, data should almost always be available from the closest region
  - Flexible Schema
  - Cache can expire 

To test all questions, simply run the 'main.py' file located in every sub-folder.

Many thanks.
